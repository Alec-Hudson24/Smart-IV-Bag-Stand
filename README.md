# Smart-IV-Bag-Stand
- The goal of this project was to design and manufactor an IV bag holder that could.  
    -  Automatically Raise and lower between 5ft and 7 ft.  
    -  Continuously track the level of fluid in the IV bag.  
    -  Alert the user when the bag gets lower than 20% of fluid.
 
-  This Project required the use of:
      -  3D Modeling (Solidworks)
      -  Electronics (Soldering & connecting to PCB boards)
      -  Coding (Arduino IDE)
