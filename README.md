# Smart-IV-Bag-Stand
**Automated, height-adjustable IV pole with real-time fluid level monitoring and low-fluid alerts**  
*(Group project: Mechanical design, electronics integration, Arduino programming)*

## Goal/ Overview
- **Primary Features**:
  - Motorized height adjustment: Automatically or manually raise/lower the IV bag between 5 ft and 7 ft for ergonomic patient/nurse access.
  - Continuous fluid level tracking: Uses a load cell/weight sensor to monitor IV bag volume.
  - Low-fluid alert: Buzzer sounds and visual indicator activates when fluid drops below 20%.
- **Motivation**: Improve hospital efficiency and patient safety by reducing manual adjustments and preventing dry IV bags.
- **Outcome**: Fully functional prototype with joystick/rotary dial controls, LED feedback (green/yellow/red for full → low), calibration button, and hinged access panel for electronics.

 
  ## Programs and skills required
- **3D Modeling & Design**: SolidWorks (parametric modeling, assemblies, STEP export for prototyping/fabrication)
- **Electronics**: Soldering, PCB connections, integration of load cell, motors, joystick, rotary encoder, LEDs, buzzer
- **Programming**: Arduino IDE (sensor reading, motor control, state machine for modes/alerts, calibration logic)
- **Other**: Team collaboration, project planning, fabrication/assembly

## Key Takeaways and lessons
- Align tasks with team members' interests → higher quality work and motivation.
- Clear, ongoing communication (plans, roles, timelines) keeps everyone aligned and reduces rework.
- Build team rapport outside project work → improves collaboration and problem-solving.

## Future Improvements / Ideas
- Add wireless alerts (e.g., Bluetooth to nurse station app)
- Integrate battery monitoring
- Refine mechanical stability for taller extensions
